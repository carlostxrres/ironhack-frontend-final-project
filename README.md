This application was developed as a final project for [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/es-en/barcelona)'s Front-End Bootcamp on June 2024. It serves as a demonstration of core competencies in Vue.js and associated technologies.

Thank you for checking out my project! ❤️

### Description

This is a simple task manager app with the following features:

- View, add, edit, and delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed or pending.
- Filter tasks by title.
- Set a timer to perform a task.
- Display the tasks in a calendar, and navigate through them.
- Mobile-first and responsive design.

### Technologies used

- Vue 3: the progressive JavaScript framework.
- Vue Router: routing for single-page applications.
- Pinia: state management.
- Supabase: backend services (user authentication and a database for the tasks).

### Possible future work

- In `EditableTitle`, exit edit mode when Enter is pressed.
- Add a skeleton loader in `TaskView`.
- Create a `CheckboxComponent`.
- Implement drag-and-drop functionality to reorder tasks.
- Make a custom checkbox component.
- Allow tasks to be deleted from the task details view.
